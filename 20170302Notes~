Degrees - Radians - Line from the x1 demo playfile
10	0.17	16
20	0.35	19
30	0.52	21
40	0.7	24
50	0,87	27

Test Result:
The first 40-degree (ln24) rotation needs to slow down.

PS:
The ln3 to ln13 (gripper open-close motion)

Recommendation:
1. The first 24 lines should remain the same
2. Ln3 to ln13 to move double quick time
3. Interpolate 7 sec after ln24 to allow the camera ready
4. After interpolation, speed up range: ln26 to ln54
